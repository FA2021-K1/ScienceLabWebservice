This repository includes the FA21 Science Lab WebService and a shared Swift Package.

## Run the Example System

You can start the Apodini example web services on any system that supports [docker](https://www.docker.com) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Follow the instructions on https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ to install docker and docker compose.
To start and test the web service, you can run the `$ docker compose up` command to start the web service. 

Xcode 13 (only available on macOS) is required to build and run the example client application. Follow the instructions on https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ to install the latest version of Xcode.

## System Functionality

The example system features an example application to manage contacts and their residences.
Please note that this is a demo system and does not include any authentication or authorization mechanisms.
It uses a database to save the contacts and residences on the web service and includes examples of sharing code between a web service and the client application.

### Web Service API

You can test out the API by starting up the web service using the `$ docker compose up` command.

**Create a New Contact Entry:**

`POST` at `/v1/contacts`, e.g. [`http://localhost/v1/contacts`](http://localhost/v1/contacts) with a payload encoded in JSON (header `Content-Type` set to `application/json`) that encodes a contact:
```json
{
 "birthday": 648225181.40703702,
 "name": "Paul"
}
```  
You can try out the following curl command to set a request to the gateway:
```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --request POST \
   --data '{"birthday": 648225181.40703702, "name": "Paul"}' \
   http://localhost/v1/contacts
```

**Get All Contacts or a Contact by ID**

`GET` at `/v1/contacts`, e.g. [`http://localhost/v1/contacts`](http://localhost/v1/contacts) that returns the stored contacts.  
You can try out the following curl command to get a list of contacts:
```bash
curl http://localhost/v1/contacts
```

You can get a single contact using `GET` at `/v1/contacts/{contactID}`, e.g. [`http://localhost/v1/contacts/E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F`](http://localhost/v1/contacts/E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F) that returns the stored contacts.  
You can try out the following curl command to get a contact by ID:
```bash
curl http://localhost/v1/contacts/E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F
```

**Update an Existing Contact:**

`POST` at `/v1/contacts/{contactID}`, e.g. [`http://localhost/v1/contacts/E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F`](http://localhost/v1/contacts/E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F) with a payload encoded in JSON (header `Content-Type` set to `application/json`) that encodes a contact:
```json
{
 "birthday": 648225181.40703702,
 "name": "Paul Schmiedmayer"
}
```  
You can try out the following curl command to set a request to the gateway:
```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --request PUT \
   --data '{"birthday": 648225181.40703702, "name": "Paul Schmiedmayer"}' \
   http://localhost/v1/contacts/E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F
```

**Delete a Contact**

You can delete a contact using `DELETE` at `/v1/contacts/{contactID}`, e.g. [`http://localhost/v1/contacts/E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F`](http://localhost/v1/contacts/E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F).

```json
{
 "address": "Munich",
